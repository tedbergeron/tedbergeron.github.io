To me the future is where you can develop web apps that access native features of the devices. You host it as a website because it *is* your website that just happens to be responsive.

The concept of getting "apps" from iTunes or Play Store becomes a thing of the past or morphs into a search engine of websites formerly called apps.

I'm so ready for the 21st century to get started.
